.TH NGCLI "1" "October 2013" "NgAdmin 0.1" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
ngcli \- command line interface tool for GS10[58]E administration
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
ngcli [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.PP
This is a cli tool intended for administration of Netgear switches that use
NSDP. Currently, only the GS105E and GS108E are concerned.
.br
It uses the readline library (if enabled at compilation) to read command lines
and supports command auto-completion with the TAB key.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B "\-a, \-\-batch"
By default, NgCli uses readline to provide an interactive command line
interface. You can disable this and use basic text input, which can be useful
for scripting purposes. You can also see \fB\-m\fR, \fB\-p\fR and \fB\-r\fR
options.
.br
If readline is disabled at compilation time, it is the default and only choice.
.
.TP
.B "\-b, \-\-keep\-broadcasting"
Keep broadcasting even when talking with a particular switch.
By default, once you login on a switch, NgAdmin talks with it using unicast.
This prevents the password from being sent to all your network. The switch
still replies using broadcast, but the password is not included in the replies.
.br
This option allows you to disable this feature and do like the official Windows
application that always use broadcast packets. This also allows to configure a
switch which is not on your network range without forcing the interface.
.br
When you enable this option, you must be aware that on every modification
you make, your password is broadcasted to all your network.
.
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-force\-interface"
Force traffic to go through the specified interface. This can be useful when
you have multiple interfaces or the switch is not on your network range.
.br
Requires root privileges.
.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Show basic help instructions.
.
.TP
\fB\-i, \-\-interface\fI iface
Set the interface to use to \fIiface\fR. Defaults to eth0 when not specified.
However, this does not force the traffic to go through this interface.
If you have multiple interfaces, you can use \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-f\fR options.
.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-local\-broadcast"
By default, NgCli uses the global broadcast address (255.255.255.255) to send
data to all the network. With this option, the interface broadcast address will
be used instead (for example 192.168.1.255). This can be useful to force
traffic to go through the specified interface without forcing the interface.
.br
However, some switches seem to ignore packets sent to this type of addresses.
.
.TP
\fB\-m, \-\-mac\fI mac
Enable automatic login. NgCli will automatically scan the network and try to
login on the switch with the MAC address \fImac\fR. \fImac\fR must be specified
as six hexadecimal bytes separated by a colon.
.
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-password\fI password
Set the password to use with automatic login to \fIpassword\fR. Be aware that
the password will be part of the command line, which means everybody on the
machine can do a "ps" to see it.
.
.TP
\fB\-r, \-\-retries\fI count
Set the maximum scan and login attempts in automatic login mode to \fIcount\fR.
Defaults to 3 when not specified and 0 means unlimited attempts.
.
.TP
\fB\-t, \-\-timeout\fI value
Define the maximum to wait for switch replies in \fIvalue\fR milliseconds.
Defaults to 4 seconds when not specified.
.
.

.SH BUGS
.
.PP
Firmware upgrade is not implemented, because it would require some work in the
library and a TFTP client.
.br
And overvall, it could be dangerous, as it is not sure that the switch checks
whatever you send to it, which could lead to a bricked device.
.
.PP
Cabletest is not totally reversed, only raw values are shown.
.br
Also, you must manually increase timeout to be able to receive results.
.
.PP
Saving and loading whole configuration into/from a file is not implemented.
