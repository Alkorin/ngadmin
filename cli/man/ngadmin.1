ngadmin \- cli tool for GS10[58]E administration

.SH SYNOPSIS
ngadmin [\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
This is a cli tool intended for administration of Netgear switches that use NSDP. 
Currently, only the GS105E and GS108E are concerned. 

.TP
\fB-b\fR
Keep broadcasting even when talking with a particular switch. 
By default, once you login on a switch, NgAdmin talks with it using unicast. 
This prevents the password from being sent to all your network. The switch 
still replies using broadcast, but the password is not included in the 
replies. This function allows you to disable this feature and do like the 
official Windows application that always use broadcast packets. 
This also allows to configure a switch which is not on your network range 
without forcing the interface. 
When you enable this option, you must be aware that on every modification 
you make, your password is broadcasted in cleartext to all your network. 



.SH COMMANDS


.SH BUGS
Currently, firmware uptade is not implemented, because it would require much 
more work in the library (and a TFTP client). 
.br
And overvall, it is quite dangerous, as it is not sure that the switch checks 
whatever you send to it.
